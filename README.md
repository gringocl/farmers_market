This was my trip to the market this morning. Every Friday we have a local market in the neighborhood.  These happen everyday in multiple places every week.  This was about 3 blocks from our place.  Chilean peso has recently weakened in value!!!  Good for me, it is now 640~ pesos to $1 USD, about 25 pesos more than in Dec. To convert price CLP/KILO to USD/LB divide CLP/1405.  All of this is local, but not organic.  Its only what is in season, so every couple of weeks it changes pretty drastically.    

This is our bounty for the week.  A nice score at $24 USD!!!
